# Python


# Time Calculator.py

This file when executed will identify the current active windows name and can be used to compute the runtime
or active runtime of each window.

# UseImdbToSortFile.py

Being a movie buff is always an issue. This file when run will monitor the folder its in for newly added movies and put 
it inside a new folder with the folder name being its Genre name.

# SubtitleResyncer.py

Another file that is helpful for movie buffs. Sometimes you'd download a subtitle and it doesn't sync with the audio and you'd feel like all your work of finding a subtitle is down to nothing. This'll help you to resync with a click. 
# NOTE: this'll resync only if the delay is consistent across the subtitle. Example : if the subtitle is slow by 10 sec from start of the movie to the end.

# NOTE

The file or folder names inside the file are always specific to my local system. Please change it if you're going to reuse it.
